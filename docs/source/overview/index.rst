Overview
========

Through a series of industry centric meetings and workshops, the U.S.  
Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability 
(DOE-OE) gathered input from utilities throughout the United States on 
their experiences in implementing, or planning to implement, ADMS.  The 
results of these meetings are documented in a February 2015 report titled `Voices of 
Experience: Insights into Advanced Distribution Management Systems <https://www.smartgrid.gov/files/ADMS-Guide_2-11.2015.pdf>`_.  

The report documents the potential benefits to utilities in implementing 
ADMS applications, and underscores the need for more affordability, a 
timely path for deploying ADMS, and the development and deployment of ADMS 
applications.  The high cost and amount of time required for ADMS 
deployment and application development was highlighted.  

In response to these needs, DOE-OE has established an ADMS program with 
this project specifically tasked with developing an open-source, standards 
based ADMS application development platform; GridAPPS-D.
