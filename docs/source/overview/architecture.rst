Figure 1: GridAPPS-D provides a method for developers (top) to run their 
new applications on a real-time simulator with extensive modeling and tool 
support (heavy box).  GridAPPS-D is built around standard data models like 
the CIM (center).  It readily interfaces to existing software products 
(right), which may also 1) use components of GridAPPS-D and 2) supplement or 
replace the built-in distribution simulator (bottom), facilitating the 
deployment of new ADMS applications to existing software products.
