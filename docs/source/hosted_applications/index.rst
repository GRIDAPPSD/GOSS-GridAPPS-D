Integrated Applications
=======================

Volt-var Optimization (VVO)
---------------------------

The sample VVO application is a Python implementation of a heuristic method that PNNL has
investigated before [CIT3]_, [CIT4]_, [CIT5]_. There are more advanced VVO methods that
could be implemented in future applications.

Visualization
-------------

We have created a web-based visualization of the sample VVO application.
The visualization displays the topology of the IEEE 8500-Node system as an
interactive graph.  Capacitors and regulators are highlighted in the graph
and displayed alongside tables with current values for capacitor status
(OPEN or CLOSED), regulator voltage, and feeder power.
